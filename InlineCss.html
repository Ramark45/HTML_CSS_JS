        Nature is defined as our environment. It is the interaction between the physical world 
        around us and the life within it like the atmosphere, climate, natural resources, ecosystem, 
        flora, fauna and humans. Nature also includes non-living things such as water, mountains, 
        landscape, plants, trees and many other things.
